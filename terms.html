                <h4>Access and Registration</h4>

                <p>
                  We restrict access to our API to users who have registered with us or who have had direct contact with our team. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  We reserve the right to amend the API without warning. We will not be liable if for any reason our API is unavailable for use at any time or for any period except under our service level agreement (see below).
                </p>

                <p>
                  We will provide you with an API Access Key per application registered that will enable you to access our services.
                </p>      

                <p>
                  Your API Access Key should be considered private information and should not be shared to any person or organization. In case any accidental release, you are responsible of it revocation. Failure to abide by these terms may result in the termination of your access to services.
                </p>  

                <h4>Support Service</h4>

                <p>
                  All API users may access and use our online support materials - please see dev.redlink.io for our product documentation.

              <h2 class="card-heading simple anchor" id="service-level-agreement">Service Level Agreement</h2>
              
              <div class="card-body"> 

                <p>
                  The service level agreement (“SLA”) is available only to paying clients of Redlink’s API (including those accessing it as on-premise installation at their site) and is ruled by direct contracts defining the SLA for each specific client and/or usage scenario. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  You will not be entitled to any credit on our platform under this or any other SLA if you are in breach of these API terms of use or if your account had been suspended or closed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  There are not SLA if you’ve been given the option of using our API but you are not paying our service.
                </p> 

                <h4>Nature of the SLA</h4>

                <p>
                  Our SLA does not cover the performance of the network or the internet as it is measured at the points at which our API connects to the internet. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  In particular, this SLA does not cover anything that is beyond our control, including reasonable control (including without limitation, acts of God, acts of government, flood, fire, earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labour problems, computer, telecommunications, Internet service provider or hosting facility failures or delays involving hardware, software or power systems and denial of service attacks) It also does not cover service levels from our data providers (i.e. DBpedia) or our platform partners (i.e. Machine Linking).
                </p>

                <p>
                  The platform credit that might be offered under this SLA is the exclusive remedy for our API not being available. If you close your account with any credit available on it, you will lose this credit and no refund will be paid.
                </p>      

                <h4>Changes</h4>

                <p>
                  We may change, discontinue, or add to, this SLA at any time. Registered users of our API will be informed of this at least 15 days in advance – you are able to close your account before the change comes into effect if you don’t agree with it.

                <p>
